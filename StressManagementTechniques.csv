10 Second Pause,"The '10 second pause' is a technique that can be used anywhere multiple times a day to allow people to reset your minds and not become overwhelmed.
If someone does this at the beginning and end of each task, they'll find it helps them prepare for the next part of the day.
The best part is that people can do this without anyone even noticing, in situations where there are other people around.","• Put both feet flat on the floor and sit up straight

• Repeat a couple of times",Audio
Anchoring,"When people find themselves in a challenging situation, they can repeat the gesture and it should help them to recall the event, helping them feel calmer and more in control. Note that this is a helpful strategy but requires time and practice to be most effective.","Close your eyes and think of a time and place in their life when you felt very calm, relaxed and at peace in as much detail as possible, thinking about what was actually happening – any sounds, smells and other sensations.

Now, create a small gesture that you can link to this event – for example, rubbing the back of one hand with the thumb of the other or tapping a couple of fingers together. Try to link the gesture with the recall of the event as strongly as they can.",Audio
Journaling,Anytime you have a few minutes. It’s a great mind-decluttering tool because it lets you sort through what’s bothering you and expressing stress or emotions can help dissipate it.,"Write about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences in an unfiltered way. Write whatever you feel, even if it is extremely negative. Start with statements like “I feel”.

Write about specific stressors, explore their emotions, or come up with new perspectives on seeing a problem by thinking about what lesson could be learnt or seeing the situation from another person’s perspective.",Text
 Circle of Influence,"Whenever the stress stems from scenarios that are outside of your control.

This simple coaching tool allows people to help identify things that are:
• Directly within your control and over which their exert influence and can make their own choices about how to proceed
• Those things that are within their sphere of influence and which although not directly within their control, they have some influence over
• Those things that sit entirely outside their sphere of influence or control and therefore they need to develop a strategy for dealing with the outcome","This strategy involves three circles.
In the inner circle, write the things you directly control and influence, for example:
• What I choose to focus on
• My actions
In the middle circle, write everything you have some influence over but which you don’t directly control, such as:
• My health
• My income
In the outer circle, tell them to write down everything that’s worrying them but over which you have no control or influence, for example:
• The news
• The economy

Once everything is written down, it soon becomes apparent that wasting time and energy worrying about things you can neither control or influence is pointless. It then becomes much easier to accept this and to move on from worrying about them.",Text
